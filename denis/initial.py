# We want peer review assignments where everyone gives two reviews

# indeg and outdeg 2. There are many such graphs possible, but an easy
# option is to form review assignments from adjacent triplets in a
# cycle formed from all the names in a random order.

# get the wrapping around behavior we want for forming cycles. Edge case
# is the situation where there are fewer than 3 students total and it is
# impossible to have any triplets. In that case we can form two pairs,
# one singleton, or the empty list which is why we have min(len, 3)
